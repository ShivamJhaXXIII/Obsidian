#Arrays are the indexed linear data structure. 

##### Key Points to remember :-
1. The index of an array starts from 0 and ends at n - 1 index. Where n is the length of an array.
2. Array can hold elements of same data type only.
3. .length method can be used to find the length of the data. Keep in mind that it does not return the last index of the array, the last index of the array will be the returned value - 1.

## Types of Array

There are two main types of arrays:

- One-dimensional arrays: These arrays store a single row of elements.

- Multidimensional arrays:**** These arrays store multiple rows of elements.

## Array Operations

Common operations performed on arrays include:

- ****Traversal**** : Visiting each element of an array in a specific order (e.g., sequential, reverse).
- ****Insertion**** : Adding a new element to an array at a specific index.
- ****Deletion**** : Removing an element from an array at a specific index.
- ****Searching**** : Finding the index of an element in an array
