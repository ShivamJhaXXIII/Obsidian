### What is Graph?
?
A **Graph** can be defined as group of **vertices** and <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">edges that are used to connect these vertices</mark>. A graph can be seen as a cyclic tree, where the vertices (Nodes) maintain any complex relationship among them instead of having parent child relationship.

### Definition

A graph G can be defined as an ordered set G(V, E) where V(G) represents the set of vertices and E(G) represents the set of edges which are used to connect these vertices.

A Graph G(V, E) with 5 vertices (A, B, C, D, E) and six edges ((A,B), (B,C), (C,E), (E,D), (D,B), (D,A)) is shown in the following figure.

### Directed and Undirected Graph
?
A graph can be <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">directed or undirected</mark>. <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">However, in an undirected graph, edges are not associated with the directions with them</mark>. An undirected graph is shown in the above figure since its edges are not attached with any of the directions. If an edge exists between vertex A and B then the vertices can be traversed from B to A as well as A to B.
In a directed graph, edges form an ordered pair. Edges represent a specific path from some vertex A to another vertex B. Node A is called initial node while node B is called **terminal node**.
A directed graph is shown in the following figure.
