In Java, an interface is a reference type, similar to a class, that can contain only constants, method signatures, default methods, static methods, and nested types. Interfaces cannot contain instance fields or constructors. The primary purpose of an interface is to define a contract that classes can implement. This contract is essentially a set of abstract methods (methods without bodies) that the implementing class must provide concrete implementations for.
