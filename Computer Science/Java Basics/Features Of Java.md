### Simple

Java is very easy to learn, and its syntax is simple, clean and easy to understand. According to Sun Microsystem, Java language is a simple programming language because:

- Java syntax is based on C++ (so easier for programmers to learn it after C++).
- Java has removed many complicated and rarely-used features, for example, explicit pointers, operator overloading, etc.
- There is no need to remove unreferenced objects because there is an Automatic Garbage Collection in Java.

### Object-Oriented

Java is an [object-oriented](https://www.javatpoint.com/java-oops-concepts) programming language. Everything in Java is an object. Object-oriented means we organize our software as a combination of different types of objects that incorporate both data and behavior.

Object Oriented programming (oops) is a methodology that simplifies software development and maintenance by providing some rules.

Basic Concepts of OOPs are :-
- [[Object]]
- [[Class]]
- [[Inheritance]]
- [[Polymorphism]]
- [[Abstraction]]
- [[Encapsulation]]
